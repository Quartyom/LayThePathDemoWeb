Game modes:
All the levels in Play were selected and added manually, while in Zen they are generated randomly. So in the first mode levels are harder in average, but Zen levels are infinite on the other hand.
Editor mode is experimental and it was initially created to simplify my developer's life. You can also build levels there and launch them. Save option is unavailable so far.

Q&A:
What if level is impassible? Well, unlikely. You can checkout the hint or skip the level.
How to reset the progress? Go to your system settings and delete data.

App:
Coded in Java, libgdx framework in July of 2022.
