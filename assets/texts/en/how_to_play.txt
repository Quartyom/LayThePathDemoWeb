Lay the path to cover all the available cells of the field. Hold your finger on the board and move it.
You may not cross yourself or obstacles. A path must start and end in an empty cell, but it can pass through diagonal walls, dots, and the path itself on turns.
You can only move straight through crossroads.
If the move is forbidden, you will notice it, otherwise do not limit yourself and have fun.
