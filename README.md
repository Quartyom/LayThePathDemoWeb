A web demo of the game Lay the path
Google Play: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.quartyom 
Demo: https://quartyom.itch.io/lay-the-path-demo

How to play:
Lay the path to cover all the available cells of the field. Hold your finger on the board and move it.
You may not cross yourself or obstacles. A path must start and end in an empty cell, but it can pass through diagonal walls, dots, and the path itself on turns.
You can only move straight through crossroads.
If the move is forbidden, you will notice it, otherwise do not limit yourself and have fun.

Game modes:
All the levels in Play were selected and added manually, while in Zen they are generated randomly. So in the first mode levels are harder in average, but Zen levels are infinite on the other hand.
Editor mode is experimental and it was initially created to simplify my developer's life. You can also build levels there and launch them. Save option is unavailable so far.

Q&A:
What if level is impassible? Well, unlikely. You can checkout the hint or skip the level.
How to reset the progress? Go to your system settings and delete data.

App:
Coded in Java, libgdx framework in July of 2022.
